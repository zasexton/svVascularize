# Crease Detection Improvements - Summary

## Changes Made to `svv/simulation/utils/extract_faces.py`

### 1. Geometric Center-Based Normal Correction (Lines 371-392)
**Problem:** Previous implementation used point normals averaged from face vertices, which are ambiguous at crease boundaries.

**Solution:** Orient normals based on geometric centers relative to mesh centroid.

```python
def correct_normals(cell_normals, face_vertices, mesh):
    # Compute face centers and mesh centroid
    # Orient normals away from center for consistent results
```

**Benefits:**
- More robust at sharp edges and corners
- Consistent orientation across crease boundaries
- Eliminates ambiguity from point normal averaging

### 2. Partition-Average Normal Tracking (Lines 416-440)
**Problem:** Algorithm compared neighbors against current element's normal, allowing "drift" across curved surfaces.

**Solution:** Track running average of partition's normal and compare all neighbors against it.

```python
# Track partition's average normal
partition_normal = cell_normals[current_element, :].copy()
partition_count = 1

while len(check) > 0:
    # Update running average
    partition_normal = ((partition_normal * partition_count) + current_normal) / (partition_count + 1)
    partition_count += 1
    partition_normal = partition_normal / numpy.linalg.norm(partition_normal)
    
    # Compare against partition average, not current element
    face_angle = numpy.arccos(numpy.clip(numpy.dot(partition_normal, cell_normals[i, :]), -1, 1))
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents partition from drifting across true creases
- More stable on curved surfaces
- Better global coherence within partitions

### 3. Graph-Based Wall Combination (Lines 288-443)
**Problem:** Previous O(n⁶) nested loop implementation was complex and inefficient.

**Solution:** Replace with graph-based connected components algorithm.

**New Functions:**
- `has_matching_boundary()` - Check if two walls share a complete boundary
- `check_all_boundaries_matched()` - Verify all boundaries are properly matched
- `combine_walls_graph_based()` - Use DFS to find connected components

**Benefits:**
- Reduced complexity from O(n⁶) to O(n²)
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Easier to understand and debug
- More efficient for large meshes

## Testing Results

All three improvements:
✓ Import successfully without errors
✓ Pass basic functionality tests
✓ Maintain backward compatibility

## Performance Impact

- **Normal correction:** Same O(n) complexity, but more accurate
- **Partition algorithm:** Same O(n) complexity, but prevents false splits
- **Wall combination:** Improved from O(n⁶) to O(n²) - significant speedup for meshes with many walls

## Recommendations for Further Testing

1. Test on meshes with:
   - Sharp box corners (90° creases)
   - Smooth cylinders (should not split)
   - Mixed geometry (sharp + curved)
   - Degenerate/collapsed elements

2. Verify:
   - All faces assigned exactly once
   - Creases detected at correct angles
   - No over-partitioning on smooth surfaces

3. Performance benchmarks on large meshes (10K+ faces)
